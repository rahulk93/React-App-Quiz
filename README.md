This repository is about Quiz application in React JavaScript library. This application has the ability to generate fifty number of questions in each category. It has 
ability to flip the card over once the user click to check the answer. This React web application is based YouTube video called "How To Build A Flashcard Quiz With React"
and it's URL is: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEtZ040fsD8 . I watched and studied this video as part of becoming competent ReactJS web developer. 

A user can choose a category to test himself or herself. The application does not record any points for answering the question correctly.

**What I learnt while making this application above:** I learnt many things while making this application such as connecting to API, producing categories, forms and forms 
groups. I also learnt how to filip the cards.   

**How might I improve:** Limit the number of questions that user type in. For example, user type in between 1 and 50. Redeploy this React application for my Visual 
Studios Code software so that code can be seen by public.
